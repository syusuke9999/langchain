    "# Research Chain\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an experimental research chain that tries to answer \"researchy\" questions using information on the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Compile information about Albert Einstein.\n",
    "Ignore if it's a different Albert Einstein. \n",
    "Only include information you're certain about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Include:\n",
    "* education history\n",
    "* major contributions\n",
    "* names of spouse \n",
    "* date of birth\n",
    "* place of birth\n",
    "* a 3 sentence short biography\n",
    "\n",
    "Format your answer in a bullet point format for each sub-question.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or replace `Albert Einstein` with another person of interest (e.g., John Smith of Boston).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The chain is composed of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A searcher that searches for documents using a search engine.\n",
    "    - The searcher is responsible to return a list of URLs of documents that\n",
    "      may be relevant to read to be able to answer the question.\n",
    "2. A downloader that downloads the documents.\n",
    "3. An HTML to markdown parser (hard coded) that converts the HTML to markdown.\n",
    "    * Conversion to markdown is lossy\n",
    "    * However, it can significantly reduce the token count of the document\n",
    "    * Markdown helps to preserve some styling information\n",
    "      (e.g., bold, italics, links, headers) which is expected to help the reader\n",
    "      to answer certain kinds of questions correctly.\n",
    "4. A reader that reads the documents and produces an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "* Quality of results depends on LLM used, and can be improved by providing more specialized parsers (e.g., parse only the body of articles).\n",
    "* If asking about people, provide enough information to disambiguate the person.\n",
    "* Content downloader may get blocked (e.g., if attempting to download from linkedin) -- may need to read terms of service / user agents appropriately.\n",
    "* Chain can be potentially long running (use initialization parameters to control how many options are explored) -- use async implementation as it uses more concurrency.\n",
    "* This research chain only implements a single hop at the moment; i.e.,\n",
    "  it goes from the questions to a list of URLs to documents to compiling answers.\n",
    "  Without continuing the crawl, web-sites that require pagnation will not be explored fully.\n",
    "* The reader chain must match the type of question. For example, the QA refine chain \n",
    "  isn't good at extracting a list of entries from a long document.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Extending\n",
    "\n",
    "* Continue crawling documents to discover more relevant pages that were not surfaced by the search engine.\n",
    "* Adapt reading strategy based on nature of question.\n",
    "* Analyze the query and determine whether the query is a multi-hop query and change search/crawling strategy based on that.\n",
    "* Break components into tools that can be exposed to an agent. :)\n",
    "* Add cheaper strategies for selecting which links should be explored further (e.g., based on tf-idf similarity instead of gpt-4)\n",
    "* Add a summarization chain on top of the individually collected answers.\n",
    "* Improve strategy to ignore irrelevant information."

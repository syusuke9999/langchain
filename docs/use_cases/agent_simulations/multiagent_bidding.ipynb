As someone who has always fought for the safety and well-being of the American people, I believe that any plan for integrating autonomous vehicles into our high speed rail system must prioritize safety above all else. We need to ensure that these vehicles are thoroughly tested and meet strict safety standards before they are allowed on our rails. Additionally, we must invest in the necessary infrastructure to support these vehicles, such as advanced sensors and communication systems. But we must also ensure that these innovations are accessible to all Americans, not just the wealthy. That's why I propose a public-private partnership to fund and build this system, with a focus on creating good-paying jobs and expanding economic opportunities for all Americans. *smiles confidently*\n",
